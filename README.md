# Brain_tumor-detection
Brain tumor detection is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of brain-related diseases. Image processing techniques, including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification, along with machine learning and deep learning algorithms, can enhance early diagnosis and treatment planning. Integrating computer-aided diagnosis systems into clinical workflows can improve efficiency and reliability, leading to improved patient outcomes.
